# Battleship Game Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Battleship game project, explaining the organization of packages and their responsibilities.

## Package Responsibilities

### `cmd/battleship`
The entry point of the application that:
- Loads and validates configuration
- Initializes core components
- Manages application lifecycle
- Handles graceful shutdown

### `internal/app`
The application core that:
- Manages application configuration
- Provides configuration validation
- Defines configuration defaults
- Handles environment variable loading

### `internal/game`
The game logic layer that:
- Implements game rules and mechanics
- Manages game state
- Handles player interactions
- Validates game moves
- Contains game-related models and types

### `internal/server`
The HTTP server layer that:
- Implements the HTTP server
- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Provides middleware functionality
- Manages routing and endpoints
- Implements request validation

### `internal/storage`
The data persistence layer that:
- Defines the storage interface
- Manages database connections
- Handles data persistence operations
- Provides data access abstractions
- Implements specific storage backends (e.g., MongoDB)

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each package has a single responsibility
   - Clear boundaries between packages
   - Minimal package dependencies

2. **Interface-based Design**
   - Core interfaces define package boundaries
   - Implementation details are hidden
   - Easy to swap implementations

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Centralized configuration
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Type-safe configuration
   - Validation at startup

4. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error types
   - Proper error wrapping
   - Clear error messages
   - Graceful error recovery

5. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Interface-based testing
   - Mock implementations
   - Integration tests

## Dependencies

- External packages are kept to a minimum
- Core Go standard library is preferred
- Third-party packages are carefully chosen
- Version management through go.mod

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling support
   - Load balancing
   - Caching layer
   - Rate limiting

2. **Monitoring**
   - Metrics collection
   - Health checks
   - Logging
   - Tracing

3. **Security**
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Input validation
   - Rate limiting

4. **Deployment**
   - Containerization
   - Orchestration
   - CI/CD
   - Environment management
